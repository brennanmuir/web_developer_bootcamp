  <h2>What is the purpose?</h2>

  <p>This website is to act as a live demo of assignments I am completing through the Udemy Course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4">Web Developer Bootcamp.</a>

  <p>I plan on updating this page throughout the course with what I've learned. You can track my assignment progress through my <a href="https://github.com/brennanmuir/web_developer_bootcamp">Github.</a> </p>
